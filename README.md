# Dev-Dashboard

Dev Dashboard will give you a complete LAMP stack in a local dev environment. It will setup your Git repos as sub-directories
in the /var/www/html folder so with a simple "dashboard" to access your projects. This script was built and tested using
Linux. Results may vary on MAC or Windows.
